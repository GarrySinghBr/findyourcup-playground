List of Canadian Cities for Manual Deployment

Note: Most cities selected are high on the population rank as they will proportionately have more data
available. However, for our current testing, I'm going to skip some entries and add smaller/geographically 
obscure cities. Additionally, we could test with clustered data like Ottawa & Gatineau as seperate points.

These aren't distinctly cities or towns, but they're refered to as 'Population Centres'. From our current
issues, this is viable. The Wiki has a good explanation on population centres vs municipalities.
